The Otto Robot, created using a Raspberry Pi Pico, is a compact and versatile humanoid robot designed for both educational and interactive applications. This robot uses a combination of servomotors for movement, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver for efficient servo control. The circuit is powered by a 9V battery regulated through an LM7805 voltage regulator, ensuring stable power delivery to the components. Its modular design and the use of open-source hardware make it an excellent platform for hobbyists and educators looking to explore robotics and programming.

This Otto Robot is programmed to perform a variety of actions such as greeting, walking, dancing, and avoiding obstacles. By controlling the servomotors through the Raspberry Pi Pico, the robot can mimic basic human-like movements, making it both engaging and functional. Its obstacle avoidance capability, enabled by the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, allows it to navigate environments intelligently, avoiding collisions and moving autonomously. Additionally, the inclusion of fun features like dance and walking animations enhances its appeal for interactive learning and entertainment.

The project highlights the simplicity and versatility of the Raspberry Pi Pico, showcasing its ability to control multiple peripherals simultaneously. By integrating sensors and actuators, this Otto Robot offers a hands-on approach to understanding electronics, coding, and robotics. The design also provides opportunities for customization, encouraging users to expand its functionality further or adapt it to specific applications. This makes it a perfect project for enthusiasts and beginners eager to dive into the world of robotics.
